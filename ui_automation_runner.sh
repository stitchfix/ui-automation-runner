# Created by Sohail Ahmed

#
# This script provides a nice abstraction over the 'instruments' command line tool, especially when targeting
# the iOS Simulator where device directories and fully qualified app paths are frequently changing.
# The key benefit of using this script is so that by specifying intent (i.e. which simulator, what app),
# you can be abstracted from having to hunt down the appropriate folders and paths themselves to pass to Apple's
# own command line tool (which does not automatically resolve these paths for you).
#
# Of course, you still need to pass information like where the test file you wish to run is located, what simulator (by name)
# you wish to run the test on and where you'd like the test results output to go.
#
# You are not meant to edit this file except in the cases where:
#	
# 1. You'd like to turn on the debug flag ('DEBUG_MODE_ENABLED') to see more of what's happening behind the scenes
# 2. Apple changes the format of the underlying 'instruments' command and/or the location for where simulators go or the 
#	 path to the Automation Instrument template itself.
#
# This script was last edited for use with Xcode 6.0.1. If this script isn't working for you, and history is our guide, it
# could very well be that things have changed since this script was written with where you can find the Automation Instrument
# or the command line parameters that the instruments tool expects. 
#
# Note that at the present time, this script will not build your app nor will it define missing simulators. You need to ensure 
# both of these steps have been taken. The goal of this script is very focused: to run UIAutomation tests from the command line.
#
# Limitations
# * No building of your app
# * Minimal error checking and reporting when something goes wrong
# * No unix return code correcting (not sure if that's still a problem with the instruments command line tool)
#
# Usage:
# 	ui_automation_runner.sh \
#       <SIMULATOR_NAME_OR_DEVICE_UDID> \
#       <TEST_APP_NAME> \
#       <JAVASCRIPT_TEST_FILE> \
#       <JAVASCRIPT_TEST_FILES_DIRECTORY> \
#       <TEST_RESULTS_OUTPUT_PATH>
#
# You are strongly advised to use the companion example script 'run_tests.example.sh' to kick off this script. Place all of 
# your custom app and test settings in that script file, which will then kick-off this script.
#
# Note that the paths specified here must all be absolute; home directory relative paths with a tilda (~) don't work,
# although using $HOME does work.
